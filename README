promise implementation

a promise is created when u need an async function to fun before completing another task
once the async function is finished, if the function was run successfully,
    then u call the resolve function within the .then()
    if not, u call the reject function within the .catch()
u can have multiple .thens so u need to push the functions in an array while the 
async function is running and then call them back in the order that they were stored
once the async function is finished, depending on the return state
